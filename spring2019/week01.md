##Last week's Accomplishments:

In the past week, I implemented an instagram-style navigation bar. However, the git repository became corrupted, and so I had no choice but to revert the repository. After reverting the repository, firebase is now possible to use with xcode.

##This Week's Plan
This week's plan is to get more acquianted with firebase and try and get the database intertwined with the code such that login info is stored in a database.

##Anything Blocking?
I have a Foundations of Analysis exam this week along with three exams next weeks

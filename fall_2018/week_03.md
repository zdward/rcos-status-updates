## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> In the previous week, I had a bit of trouble with completing the angular tutorial but recently discovered
what was holding me back. I got 90% through but could not get the last part to work. NOW it works.

## This Week's Plan

> I plan to be well-rounded with angular by the end of the week, ready to start adding to yacs-web.



## Anything Blocking?

> Other than a quiz and an exam(next week) to study for, there is not much blocking my progress.

## Notes
 >	None.

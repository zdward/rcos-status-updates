## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> In the previous week, I had to juggle studying for 3 quizzes as well as keeping up with my weekly assignments. At the same time, finishing up rush with my fraternity held me back a little as well. I was able to learn how to go about making changes to the contrast ratio, but never got to implement what i learned.

## This Week's Plan

> I plan to at least attempt my implementation (fixing the contrast ratio) this week.



## Anything Blocking?

> Exam 2s are coming up, so I will have to juggle studying for these.

## Notes
 >	None.
